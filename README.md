# Asset-Pricing-in-the-Bond-Market
Building on the extensive body of research exploring risk factors in equity markets, we evaluated multiple factor models to analyze and explain the determinants of risk premia in the corporate bond market.

## Objective
This project examines the effectiveness of asset pricing models such as the CAPM and multi-factor models, in capturing risk premia within the corporate bond market. We used a comprehensive dataset for excess portfolios from 2003 to 2023 to evaluate classical single factor models before incorporating a momentum factor to test various combinations of multivariate factor models. Our research focuses on analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these models, assessing their consistency with theoretical expectations, and exploring potential enhancements or novel approaches to improve their practical applicability in the future.
